"about.text" = "“GUARDIANS OF HEALTH” APPLICATION \n\nDeveloped for mobiles, tablets and personal computers, the “Guardians of Health” app is part of an initiative by the Brazilian Department of Health, in partnership with the U.S.-based NGO Skoll Global Threats Fund, designed to assess the potential of mobile app use under a strategy to strengthen the detection of public health emergencies and outbreaks, within the Sistema Único de Saúde [Brazilian Unified Healthcare System] (SUS), particularly during major events, such as the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games. \n\nSuch strategy is a byproduct of another project held with the same organization, entitled “World Cup Healthcare”, launched exclusively during the 2014 FIFA Brazil World Cup®, which yielded promising results and kept both institutions’ interests aligned to develop a new strategy for the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games. \n\nThe first version of the Guardians of Health app is already available for the Apple iOS and Google Android operating systems, as well as the http://guardioesdasaude.org/ website. \n\nInitially developed in Portuguese language, subsequent versions of the “Guardians of Health” app will also be available in all of the official languages of the United Nations, provided as a supporting tool to assist foreign travelers in Brazil, particularly those traveling to the host cities of the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games. \n\nOnly users over the age of 13 can participate in this initiative. In addition, users must read and accept the “Terms of Use” before signing up and fill out the simplified registration form, providing a nickname, email address, date of birth, race/color, gender and password. Participation is voluntary and confidential, and all personal information disclosed is duly protected by Law No. 12.527, dated November 18, 2011. \n\nProject results will be used for health surveillance purposes across all Brazilian States and Municipalities, in order to detect and prevent public health emergencies and outbreaks by adopting proper prevention and control measures. The project’s results will be disclosed as consolidated and anonymous data, outlining volunteer healthcare profiles based on the information provided by app users. \n\nVoluntary participation \n\nYour participation is entirely voluntary and a valuable contribution towards promoting health surveillance in Brazil. Filling out his health form may not be interpreted as a medical appointment and does not ensure special access to health care services. In addition, users will never be contacted via email or any other means by any healthcare service or professional to obtain such information. \n\nText messages can be sent to participants through Push Notification technology, containing healthcare information or instructions from health surveillance agencies. \n\nIt is important to point out that you should immediately seek out the nearest healthcare service or physician if you are not feeling well. The app provides a shortcut to a preset search of healthcare services and drugstores near you, based on your mobile phone’s Google Maps geolocation service. This feature is not part of the app. Therefore, you will be redirected to your mobile phone’s map application. We recommend caution when transiting through unknown areas and avoiding areas of risk. Contact local public agencies for more information. \n\nThe app provides various of useful phone numbers, including SAMU (Emergency Mobile Healthcare Service), which is a 24/7 toll-free number providing emergency healthcare services for traumatic, clinical, pediatric, surgical, gynecological and mental health cases in households, workplaces and public roads. \n\nBenefits of participation \n\n•	Actively participating in health surveillance efforts to prevent disease outbreaks in communities; \n•	Quick access to public service contact information without every using your phonebook; \n•	Easy access to useful information on healthcare and disease prevention measures; \n•	Amenities such as a preset search of Emergency Care Units and drugstores nearby (20-km radius) in Google Maps; \n•	Following project results at the website: www.guardioesdasaude.org; \n\nLearn more about the app \n\nThe “Guardians of Health” app is free and available for iOS and Android operating systems, as well as Internet browsers. Users can choose from one of the several free Wi-Fi hotspots available in various cities or use their own mobile data packages to use the app. \nPhone calls to public services informed in the app may be subject to additional phone charges. Contact your mobile carrier for more information before using this feature. This service cannot be used if the mobile’s phone feature is disabled. This information applies particularly to foreign users. \n\nAbout the partnership \n\nThis pioneer initiative was conceived by the Healthcare Surveillance Agency of the Brazilian Health Department, in partnership with the host cities of the Olympic and Paralympic Games. Through such partnership, the Skill Global Threats Fund NGO is responsible for all contracting and software development expenses, duly supervised by the Brazilian Association of Field Epidemiology Professionals (ProEpi), both of which are non-profit Non-Governmental Organizations focused on improving health surveillance activities in Brazil and around the world. \nProEpi is responsible for ensuring that all requirements established by the Department of Health and Skoll Global Threats Fund are met, as per project specifications: confidentiality of user information, transparency and disclosure of public project results and availability of the source code and respective documentation in free-access download environments, adequacy and use of applications by healthcare services in Brazil and other countries, while preserving the non-profit nature of such endeavor. \n\nAcknowledgments \n\nThe organizing institutions would like to thank all volunteers, healthcare professionals and managers of the Brazilian Unified Healthcare System for depositing their trust in the pilot project and supporting such unprecedented initiative in the global public healthcare segment. \n\nSpecial thanks to the Departments of Health of the Host Cities of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (Belo Horizonte, Distrito Federal, Manaus, Rio de Janeiro, Salvador and São Paulo.)";
